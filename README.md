# readme-generator-pedro-guerra

## Description

In this bootcamp challenge, the main goal is to build on a starter code in order to successfully be able to type in information that will generate a readme file.

## Installation

If a user runs into an inquirer issue, the user should then run the command "npm i" on their terminal, and that should install all the needed files in order to be able
to successfully complete the questions.

## Usage

A user will be provided a series of questions, some pertaining to personal information, while others will be focused more heavily on the project specifically. Once the user
has answered all the questions that have been prompted, a readmefile will be generated with the responses provided by the user.
